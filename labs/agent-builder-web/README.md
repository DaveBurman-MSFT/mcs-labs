## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Navigate to [Microsoft 365 Copilot home page](https://copilot.cloud.microsoft/?auth=2&home=1)  
   _Note: if you see â€˜coming soonâ€™ try again in a few minutes._

2. Go to the **Copilot** tab.

> [!TIP]  
> Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Chat are designed for B2E (Business-to-Employee) use. Users can toggle between Work (M365 Copilot) and Web (Copilot Chat) experiences.  
>  
> Microsoft 365 Copilot is a licensed offering ($30/user/month) with premium features:
> - Integration with Office apps  
> - Enterprise data grounding (Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)  
> - Advanced capabilities (image generation, code interpreter)  
>  
> Copilot Chat is a web-grounded experience, similar to ChatGPT, and can use organizational data with a pay-as-you-go Azure subscription.  
>  
> Copilot agents come in two types:
> - **Declarative agents**: Simple, scoped tasks, use Copilot core  
> - **Custom engine agents**: Complex, external orchestration

3. If licensed, ensure youâ€™re in the **Web** tab (or you only have Web access if no toggle is visible).

4. Test the experience:
```

```

5. Select **Start a new chat** to reset.

6. Select **Create an agent**  
   _Note: if missing, refresh with Ctrl + F5._

7. Describe the agent:
```

I want to build a teacher-style agent that helps users learn about Copilot, including the differences between Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Chat, Declarative Agents vs. Custom Engine Agents, and how to use the Copilot Studio agent builder. The agent should ask questions to validate and reinforce user understanding, encourage exploration, and act as a knowledgeable guide grounded in Microsoft documentation.

```

8. Choose tone:
```

Friendly, personal, and emphatic tone. You can use irony and emojis when appropriate.

```

9. Provide websites:
```

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot)
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot)

```

10. Suggest prompt updates:
```

* Microsoft 365 Copilot vs. Copilot Chat
* Declarative vs. Custom Engine Agents
* Copilot agents governance
* Pay-as-you-go options for Copilot Chat

```

11. In **Configure**:
    - Enable Code Interpreter and Image Generator  
    - Add more sources if needed  

12. Use the test pane, then select **Create**.

13. Copy the agent link and share.

14. Test your agent:
```

```

15. To edit existing agents: **Create an agent** > **My agents**

## Test Your Understanding

**Key Takeaways:**

- Microsoft 365 Copilot vs. Copilot Chat â€“ one is grounded in Microsoft 365 data, the other in web data  
- Declarative vs. Custom Engine Agents â€“ scoped vs. orchestrated use cases  
- Grounding in trusted documentation = better answers  
- Well-designed agents prompt exploration, not just provide answers  

> [!TIP]  
> - Use short, clear prompt titles  
> - Check grounding if answers are generic  
> - Web search toggle affects response sources  

---

## Challenge

- Define your agentâ€™s tone and personality  
- Choose grounding sources (internal/public)  
- Add test questions for validation  
- Try building a second agent on another Copilot topic (governance, licensing, etc.)
