## üõ†Ô∏è Instructions by Use Case

### üß± Use Case #1: Create a solution and custom publisher

Use a structured container to group all agents components for better lifecycle management.

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to access the Solutions area of Copilot Studio, create a new solution, new publisher, and set the solution as default.

Scenario: Properly setup your development environment so that you can later easily package and deploy your agents to other environments.

**Step-by-step instructions**

1. Navigate to the Copilot Studio home page.
   [https://aka.ms/MCSStart](https://aka.ms/MCSStart)
2. Make sure you land in the expected environment by checking the top-right corner, where the environment name is displayed.
3. Go to the Solutions menu (located in the left-hand menu under the ellipsis ‚Ä¶) and select New solution.
4. Provide a display name ‚Äì this will persist across environment deployments, so avoid names tied to a specific environment (e.g., 'DEV') or development stage (e.g., 'POC'). Instead, choose a name that reflects the contents of your solution package, such as your agent or project name. For this lab, give it a name, or choose Workshop Agents.
5. If this is your first time creating a solution in this environment, create a new Publisher‚Äîthis can be your organization‚Äôs name. Choose a prefix that Copilot Studio will use for all your customizations' technical names.
6. To make sure any new components are added to this new solution by default, select Set as your preferred solution.
7. Select Create when ready.

**Test your understanding**

Now that you‚Äôve created a solution in Copilot Studio, take a moment to reflect on what you‚Äôve learned.

Key takeaways:

* Solutions first ‚Äì A solution provides a structured container to manage your agent, connectors, and future customizations across environments.
* Lifecycle readiness ‚Äì Creating a solution upfront enables better governance, easier updates, and smoother deployment.
* Naming conventions matter ‚Äì Use neutral, environment-independent names to support clean ALM practices.

Lessons learned & troubleshooting tips:

* Avoid names like ‚ÄúDEV‚Äù or ‚ÄúTest‚Äù in your solution display name‚Äîthey can cause confusion during deployments.
* If your solution fails to save, make sure the publisher prefix is unique and compliant with schema rules.
* Keep your solution name focused on the business scenario or agent purpose, not the technical phase.

**Challenge: apply this to your own use case**

* What name would you give your solution to reflect your scenario (e.g., research assistant, internal knowledge agent)?
* How might you use the solution container to organize future components, like agent flows Dataverse tables?
* Take it further: Try creating another solution for a different department or use case, and explore how solutions help you manage parallel agents with clean separation and reuse.

### üß© Use Case #2: Create environment variables and connection references

Use a structured container to group all agents components for better lifecycle management.

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to create environment variables and connection references in your solution.

Scenario: Configure your environment by anticipating future elements that will need to be updated as your solution moves from development to production.

**Step-by-step instructions**

1. Open the solution you created in the previous use case.
2. Select New, then go to More, and select Environment variable.
3. In Name, use: `Custom Knowledge Endpoint`
4. In Data Type, select Text.
5. Define a current value based on aka.ms/MCSWorkshopLabAssets
6. Click Save.

üí° **PRO TIPS**:

* Environment variables can be of various types, including Secret if you wish to retrieve secrets at runtime from an Azure Key Vault.

7. In your solution, select New, then go to More, and select Connection reference.
8. Use the name of the connector as the name, e.g., MSN Weather

   * You can also prefix it with your project name, e.g., \[MCS Training] MSN Weather
9. Select the connector: MSN Weather
10. In the connection dropdown, select New connection if no value is suggested.
11. Create the connection in Power Apps by logging in, and come back to the previous tab.
12. Refresh the connection and select the newly created one.
13. Create ‚Äì Note: if Create is grayed out, type an extra character in the Display name.
14. Repeat these steps for the below connectors:

    * Microsoft Dataverse
    * SharePoint
    * ServiceNow (based on the values in aka.ms/MCSWorkshopLabAssets)

      * For ServiceNow, use Basic Authentication

---

**Test your understanding**

* Did you create environment variables and connection references using meaningful names?
* Can you locate and update these values for different environments (e.g., dev vs prod)?
* Do your connectors reflect clean and reusable references for service authentication?

### üîÑ Use Case #3: Set up Git source control

Connect your solution to Azure DevOps Git to track changes and prepare for CI/CD‚Äîno code required.

**Summary of tasks**

In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to create a new project in Azure DevOps, how to instantiate the main branch, and how to connect it to your developer environment.

**Step-by-step instructions**

1. Navigate and log into Azure DevOps: aka.ms/MCSWorkshopADO
2. The first time you log in, you may need to confirm your user‚Äôs fictious name and country.
3. Create a project with the name for your fictitious user.
4. Select Create project
5. Once the project is created, navigate to Repos and go to Branches.
6. Choose Initialize under Initialize main branch with a README or gitignore

That‚Äôs it! Now let‚Äôs return in Copilot Studio.

7. Return to Copilot Studio (aka.ms/MCSStart), and return to the Solutions home page.
8. In the menu, select Connect to Git
9. For Connection type, select the solution.
10. Choose the CopilotStudioTraining organization, and select the project you just created, your repository. For Root git folder, set `Solutions`
11. Select Next, and select the Solution you have created in Use Case #1.
12. For Branch, select Create new branch, and call it `dev`.
13. Save
14. Connect

---

**Test your understanding**

* Can you view your solution files in the Git repo?
* Are you able to track changes and see history for your agent assets?
* Can you create a new branch for testing a change?

## üìö Summary of Learnings

True learning comes from doing, questioning, and reflecting‚Äîso let‚Äôs put your skills to the test.

To maximize the impact of your ALM setup in Copilot Studio:

* Use solutions as your foundation ‚Äì Keep all your components within a solution to simplify lifecycle management and ensure clean deployment.
* Name wisely ‚Äì Adopt a consistent naming convention and always use a custom publisher to avoid default clutter.
* Plan for portability ‚Äì Use environment variables and connection references to ensure your agent configurations adapt across dev, test, and production.
* Document post-deployment steps ‚Äì Track settings that aren‚Äôt part of the solution (e.g., authentication, channels, sharing) so nothing is missed.
* Leverage source control ‚Äì Use Git integration to track, audit, and collaborate‚Äîsetting the stage for CI/CD without complex tooling.
* Automate where it counts ‚Äì Consider using pipelines with Azure DevOps or GitHub for streamlined, repeatable deployments.

## üìå Conclusions and Recommendations

**ALM golden rules:**

* Work in the context of solutions.
* Create separate solutions only if you need to deploy components independently.
* Use a custom publisher and prefix to maintain clarity and traceability.
* Use environment variables for settings and secrets that change across environments.
* Export and deploy solutions as managed, unless you're setting up a dev environment.
* Avoid customizing outside of dev.
* Consider automating ALM for source control and CI/CD pipelines.

By following these principles, you‚Äôll establish a robust, scalable foundation for managing Copilot agents and Power Platform assets across their full lifecycle.

| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solution             | A container in Power Platform that groups related components (like agents, flows, environment variables) for better organization, deployment, and lifecycle management.                      |
| Publisher            | A label associated with your solution components. Using a custom publisher helps track ownership and apply consistent naming prefixes.                                                       |
| Environment          | A workspace in Power Platform where apps, agents, and data reside. ALM best practices often involve multiple environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) for structured deployments.                |
| Environment variable | A reusable setting (like a URL or key) that can vary between environments without modifying individual components.                                                                           |
| Connection reference | An abstraction that links connectors (e.g., SharePoint, Dataverse) to credentials and environment-specific settings‚Äîallowing reuse and cleaner ALM processes.                                |
| Managed solution     | A read-only version of a solution used for deployment to downstream environments (test, prod). Managed solutions support clean, controlled updates.                                          |
| Unmanaged solution   | Editable solutions used in development environments. Changes in unmanaged solutions can be exported, versioned, and eventually deployed as managed.                                          |
| Solution-aware       | A component or setting that is included in a solution and can be moved across environments as part of it. Not all Copilot Studio settings are solution-aware.                                |
| Source control       | The practice of tracking and managing changes to your assets over time. In Power Platform, Git integration with Azure DevOps or GitHub helps enable collaboration, auditing, and automation. |
| CI/CD                | A practice of automating the build, testing, and deployment of solutions using tools like Azure DevOps pipelines or GitHub Actions.                                                          |
