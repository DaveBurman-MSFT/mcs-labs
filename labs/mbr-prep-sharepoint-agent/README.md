## ü§î Why This Matters

**Managers and Team Leads** ‚Äì Drowning in slide decks, scattered data, and last-minute scramble sessions before Monthly Business Reviews?

Think of a traditional MBR prep process:  
- **Without agents**: Leaders dig through dozens of decks, copy/paste insights, manually summarize risks and themes, and chase down team updates ‚Äì all while trying to spot patterns across silos  
- **With agents**: AI reads files from SharePoint, extracts key themes (like at-risk deals or blockers), and delivers concise summaries you can act on ‚Äì no digging required

**Common challenges solved by this lab:**
- "We waste hours each month trying to consolidate MBR decks from every team"
- "Leadership misses key risks or repetitive asks buried in PowerPoint files"
- "It's hard to spot trends across different teams without a data analyst"
- "We're reactive instead of proactive when it comes to business risks"

**In just 10 minutes, you‚Äôll learn how to build an agent that helps leaders get to the ‚Äòso what‚Äô faster‚Äîturning static decks into actionable insights.**

## üåê Introduction

Monthly Business Reviews (MBRs) are critical for keeping leadership informed, identifying risks, and aligning on key initiatives. But the preparation process is often tedious and fragmented, requiring hours of manual effort to gather, review, and summarize insights from multiple teams.

**Real-world example:** A regional sales org prepares for its MBR by collecting slide decks from over 10 team leads. Each deck includes updates, at-risk deals, and escalations‚Äîburied across inconsistent formats and file names. A single director spends 4‚Äì6 hours manually scanning each one, summarizing recurring themes, and building a master summary for leadership.

After implementing an agent, the director simply prompts the system to scan the latest MBR files in SharePoint. Within seconds, the agent highlights common risks, summarizes recurring asks, and surfaces trends across teams. Now the director can focus on strategic insights‚Äînot file wrangling.

## üéì Core Concepts Overview

| Concept | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Conversational Agent** | Powers natural, chat-like interactions so users can ask about MBR themes, risks, and takeaways without needing to dig through files manually |
| **Knowledge** | Enables the agent to read and understand content from past MBR decks stored in SharePoint, so it can extract relevant insights and patterns |
| **Testing in Copilot Studio** | Helps you validate that the agent understands user intent and returns accurate, useful responses before it's shared with others |
| **Publishing to SharePoint** | Makes the agent accessible to your team directly from a SharePoint site, so anyone preparing for an MBR can use it on demand |
| **SharePoint Agent Setup** | Seamlessly integrates with your existing file storage so your agent always has access to the latest MBR decks‚Äîno need to move files around |

## üéØ Summary of Targets

In this lab, you'll build a conversational MBR agent that streamlines how managers and leaders access insights across Monthly Business Review decks. By the end of the lab, you will:

* Create and configure a conversational agent using Copilot Studio
* Add knowledge sources by linking SharePoint-stored MBR files to the agent
* Test the agent to ensure it can accurately summarize risks, trends, and key themes
* Publish the agent to a SharePoint site so it's easily accessible to stakeholders
* Enable your team to ask questions like ‚ÄúWhat are the common risks this month?‚Äù and get immediate, actionable answers
